        <h2>Blake's Background</h2>

        <!--Information about early life-->
        <h4>Upbringing:</h4>
        <p>I was born in Oak Lawn, Illinois on February 28th, 1997. Though initially living in Oak Lawn for some time, my family relocated to Huntley, Illinois. It is here where I initially started my grade school education.</p>
        <p>After a few years of school, we relocated once more to Chicago, Illinois, where I would eventually graduate from grade school.</p>

        <!--Information about teenage years and high school-->
        <h4>Teen Years:</h4>
        <p>Shortly after graduating from grade school, my family once again relocated to Chicago Ridge, Illinois where I would attend High School.</p>
        <p>It was in high school that I began joining various clubs and participating in several activities. In addition to the drama and speech teams, I was a member of my high school's National Honors Society.</p>
        <p>While in high school, I explored as many technology courses as I possibly could. Not only did technology always fascinate me, but now I was actively looking forward to coming to school to build on my knowledge in this area.</p>
        <p>Because of my interest in technology and my performance in high school, I was admitted to the Illinois Institute of Technology on a scholarship. I still regard the day I learned this as the proudest I've ever been.</p>

        <!--Relevant Information regarding goals-->
        <h4>Current Aspirations:</h4>
        <p>Though initially I began my education at IIT as a Computer Science student, I switched to the Information Technology & Management major. This was due to the fact that what I had experienced in my CS classes was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a more hands-on education, and this is what I saw was being offered by the ITM department.</p>
        <p>My main interests are software development and managing database management systems.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working towards a specialization in data management and analytics in addition to the bachelor's degree in ITM.</p>

        <!--Future goals and aspirations-->
        <h4>Future:</h4>
        <p>Though the future is uncertain, I plan on pursuing a master's degree from IIT after my initial graduation.</p>
        <p>My ideal future job have to be that of a database administrator.</p>
        <p>In regards to location, I do not plan on leaving the Chicago area any time soon.</p>
